    Use priv->geometry rather than priv->attrib, since priv->attrib could be updated by XGetWindowAttributes
    which is a synchronous operation

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2011-08-13

    Don't check against the XWindowAttributes that are stored when sending resize
    notfications, since they could have been updated synchronously with XGetWindowAttributes
    and could be out of sync with the geometry last received from the server which is what
    we need to process requests based on.
    
    Fixes cases where plugins didn't get that geometry update because of this condition,
    which caused bugs like distorted windows in opengl since the window matrices were
    wrong

    [PATCH] Don't unredirect overlay windows until we have set the new
    bounding shape for the output window.
    
    Unredirecting them before this time meant that they were stacked
    underneath the overlay window and changing the bounding shape of
    the output window would cause an expose event to be sent to
    the overlay window causing a breif flicker as it redraws.
    
    Unredirecting after this means that no expose event is sent because
    the backing store is only set again after the bounding shape of the
    output window has been changed

    Read the current override redirect state as the client may have
    changed it while CreateNotify is being processed and thus
    we could be reparenting and override redirect window.
    
    Also ensure that when unreparenting windows that their
    parent is still the wrapper window, otherwise
    don't bother to reparent them back into the root
    window, this will only cause trouble.
    
    Fixes LP#767095

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2011-05-26

      XSync right after configureXWindow in cases where we
      need to immediately reorder the window stack.
    
      This isn't a real fix, but at least fixes the following situation without
      breaking the API and ABI
    
      Windows stacked A, B, C
    
      Plugin does: C->raise (), B->raise (), A->raise ()
      Window list should read at this point: ... C, B, A ... (screen->windows ())
      However, the output buffer hasn't been flushed at this point
      so server side we will have A, B, C.
    
      Now if a sneaky client tries to restack A above C, we will get the
      ConfigureRequest for that, and instead of getting B, C, A like the client
      expects, we'll actually get C, B, A.
    
      The real solution is to have a list of windows last sent to the server
      and a list of windows last recieved by it. That way plugins can
      mess with the internal stack all they want, but when recieving
      events for X as to the actual state of things, they can restack relative
      to the server list.

    Add hack to allow the KDE4 Window decorator to work correctly with the new
    decoration interface, until KDE4 Window decorator is re-written to allow
    for decoration lists.
    
    Note that this gives public access to KWD::Decorator, which is a bad thing.
    
    The way this works is to create two separate frames for inactive and active
    decoration, and when one property is written to update the other.

    Release implicit grabs as soon as we handle events.
    
    Implicit keyboard grabs which are created by the pressing and holding of a key
    that was passively grabbed by XGrabKey are evil for a number of reasons.First
    of all, there isn't any way to track them or to track which window they are
    grabbed on so if a plugin makes an active grab and then releases it, the
    passive grab is released on release, which means there is an inconsistency
    between holding the key and having the grab. Secondly, if plugins actually
    need a grab on all keys, they are better switching to an active grab
    rather than relying on the passive one. Finally, if there is a passive grab by
    another application by a key-modifier combo which has the same modifier mask
    as the currently activated passive grab, then it means that this application
    won't get its grab activated as long as the modifier is held down.

    Don't treat synthetic UnmapNotify the same as the real UnmapNotify
    
    ICCCM section 4.1.4 says that applications need to send us a synthetic
    UnmapNotify to tell us that the window has been withdrawn in all cases
    to cover the case where a window is already unmapped and then withdrawn.
    
    In this case we should handle the UnmapNotify as a request to withdraw
    the window, but we should only handle the *real* UnmapNotify request
    as a request to actually process the window being unmapped and withdraw
    it there, rather than processing both twice and withdrawing the window
    twice

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2011-03-11

    Don't refuse to update frame extents for windows that have an unmap reference
    
    The previous rationale for not updating these extents is that doing so will
    cause a resizeNotify on windows that are currently being unmapped or
    that plugins have delayed from being unmapped and this will cause core
    to throw out the texture of those windows. A better solution here
    would be to not throw out the decoration pixmap and texture for windows
    that are currently being unmapped (and also not throwing out the pixmap
    in the composite plugin), since it would be likely that plugins are
    using them for animations

    Rationale: If the user has their PKG_CONFIG_PATH set to /foo/bar
    they would expect that when doing things like, eg installing plugins
    locally (which ignores CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX), that the buildsystem
    would pick up pkg-config files from their PKG_CONFIG_PATH which they
    have specified themselves and not the default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX,

    Sync after ungrabbing the server.
    
    Turns out that XUngrabServer is not a synchronous call, so there is a
    race condition with the new startup order where the ungrab server request
    will sit in the output buffer waiting to be processed and the server won't
    actually be ungrabbed when we start loading plugins. This can have all
    kinds of side effects, for example when initializing GConf with GDBus,
    there will be a call to dbus-launch --autostart to try and get the
    session bus ID which will fail if there is still a server grab
    that hasn't been released (since it attempts to read X11 properties)

    Allow different font types in frames.
    
    Currently we used a single PangoContext and PangoFontDescription for
    everything ... this resulted in custom frames having the same titlebar
    size which wasn't any good. This commit changes a lot, namely:
    
     * Frame is now linked to the decoration object itself
     * Moved style windows into the frame
     * Moved font context and font description into the frame
     * Added API for getting the titlebar font size: obviously with the
    cairo decorations there isn't supposed to be any kind of visual
    difference here but with the metacity decorations we need to get that
    directly from libmetacity.
    
    It should be noted that these commits are in need of a cleanup ... which
    is coming in the next few commits.

    Fixes LP: #709461

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2011-02-10

    Make the switcher window being override redirect.
    
    Previously the switcher window was a normal managed window (which
    the switcher plugin actually lied about, see SwitchWindow::managed),
    such that the decorators could pick it up and draw the switcher
    decoration. However now with reparenting, this means that whenever
    we actually manage and unmanage the switcher window (eg with map
    and unmap) it means we must also reparent the window, which floods
    the server with requests and makes the switcher slow.
    
    Since we don't interact with the switcher window, it makes no sense
    to manage it like this, so make it override redirect

    Allow semantic difference between frame window geometry and frame size.
    
    Rationale: some window decorators or themes might want to specify a border
    input area that is slightly larger than the visible borders on screen
    (eg for enhanced resize handles, a11y purposes, etc) or the theme might
    want to specify some additional decoration which should affect placement
    but should not be interacted with.
    
    In this case we have a priv->border and priv->input window property.
    priv->border specifies the actual semantic size of the window decoration
    that should affect placement and priv->input specifies the extents of
    the frame window past the client.

    Wait for reparent and configure operations to complete before destroying.
    
    We don't track frame and wrapper windows like normal windows, so if we want
    to restack relative to the frame window on unreparent then we need to ensure
    that the restack operation actually completed before destroying the window.

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2011-01-28

    We don't care about events happening on the wrapper window during unreparent

    frame window on the wrapper window, which will be handled by compiz making

    Fix stacking madness
    
    1) Don't create windows after registering for CreateNotify on the root
       window and then do XQueryTree after calling XCreateWindow since this
       will add the window to the internal stack twice (once for
       XQueryTree and once for the CreateNotify)
    
    2) Enforce a full restack on all windows once we have decided
       what our initial stack order is - so that dock windows don't
       end up going underneath desktop windows
    
    3) Immediately stack the frame window underneath the client
       and wait for the stacking operation to complete before reparenting
       since sometimes the frame window would be created and mapped at the
       top of the X11 stack whereas the client window would be tracked
       from the bottom of the stack. Remove hack to restack window
       within compiz since that didn't actually work.

    The window could have been destroyed by the time we do XGetWindowAttributes

    anyways - but only because in between the time when we handle the DestroyNotify

    asking us to stack windows relative to it

    Don't create CompWindow and initialize plugins until MapRequest.
    
    Having all plugins track windows on CreateNotify doesn't make any
    sense because they are not visible, and the ones that they would
    need to track would be override-redirect anyways. Also tracking
    windows in this way broke reparenting in such a way that a number
    of buggy applications using xembed (eg gnome-panel applets and
    Adobe Flash would consistently crash).

Sam Spilsbury <smspillaz@gmail.com>	2011-01-12

    Don't stack mapping windows which requested no focus above the active window.
    
    This adds a managing variable to PrivateWindow which represents the managing
    state of the window. In addition, ::updateAttributes did not stack windows
    below correctly if they were already directly on top of an active window
    (since it is not valid to stack a window below itself, and the algorithm would
    pass the below to the findValidStackSiblingBelow function as well as a
    pointer to the active window (== below)). The function now compares the
    below sibling to the window we want to be stacked.

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2010-12-06

    Fix startup order.
    
    Previously we were doing something like this:
    
    init -> screen init -> init core plugin screen -> create windows ->
    eventLoop -> updatePlugins -> initPlugin (initScreen (initWindow))).
    
    This order has a number of problems with it - namely that config plugins
    will be loaded on one full pass of the event loop and then core options
    are initialized, before which we were doing certain startup procedures
    on the default options, which resulted in strange race condition bugs.
    Also, if we are compositing we have a brief (visible) switch from 2D mode
    to 3D mode - in reality we want to be in 3D mode ASAP.
    
    The new order is init -> updatePlugins (load plugins specified on command
     line) -> screen init -> load command line plugins -> update plugins (load
    new plugins specified by config plugins on the command line) -> init screens
    -> create window (init plugins for window) -> eventLoop.
    
    This means that it takes longer for us to get to the event loop, but at least
    we can zip through the initialization phase quite quickly

    Fix windows consistently moving by gravity * window decoration extents.
    
    The behaviour from 0.8 was ported to update decoration windows on the window destructor, but because we are moving windows on a timer in order to handle reparenting issues when decorating them, this also causes the time to be destroyed when the CompWindow is, so the windows never actually get moved back into place correctly.
    
    FIXME: Timers should have a referencing system, it does not make sense that we have to preserve their scope

    Previously, we left the position of windows that have USPosition set

    Don't increase leave pendingMaps at a non-zero number once the window is mapped.
    We used to assume that for every MapRequest event that we got for which we also sent an XMapWindow that we would get a MapNotify. According to the man XMapWindow this doesn't make any sense since trying calling XMapWindow on an already mapped window for which we have SubstructureRedirectMask set results in a NoOp anyways (so we'll only ever get one MapNotify and multiple MapRequests). This fixes a case where no input focus would be set on closing windows with multiple remaining pendingMaps since we don't move the input focus if this is the case

    Don't increase leave pendingMaps at a non-zero number once the window is mapped.
    
    We used to assume that for every MapRequest event that we got for which we also sent an XMapWindow that we would get a MapNotify.
    
    According to the man XMapWindow this doesn't make any sense since trying calling XMapWindow on an already mapped window for which we have SubstructureRedirectMask set results in a NoOp anyways (so we'll only ever get one MapNotify and multiple MapRequests).
    
    This fixes a case where no input focus would be set on closing windows with multiple remaining pendingMaps since we don't move the input focus if this is the case

    [PATCH] Be a little bit more clever when handing option construction in handleActionEvent.
    
    Previously we would have a static CompAction::Vector which we would resize to lower sizes (so that triggerFooBindings doesn't die) but this causes us to be reconstruction CompOptions all the time which is expensive.
    
    Instead just reset the option to make it "dead" (eg keep it in memory for longer) but don't create and recreate them all the time
    
    Also copy the active state of a CompAction on copy-construct

    Check if header token matches part of another word.
    
    The prepending function would only check for the existence of part of the header op in the function string, and did not check if the matched string was actually part of another word. This caused fragment programs like this to fail:
    
    program name: temporary
    !!ARBfp1.0
    TEMP temp, foo, bar;
    FOO temp, bar, temp;
    
    Which would be outputted like this:
    
    TEMP temporary_temp, temporary_foo, temporary_bar;
    FOO temporary_temporary_temp, bar, temporary_temporary_bar;
    
    (since "temp" was matched in "temporary" incorreclty).
    
    The new code now checks for a ".", ";" or "," or if the word is the last in the string before prepending it.
    
    This bug was most noticable in the colorfilter plugin, where one of the filters could be named "negative" with a temporary variable called "neg"

    Sometimes there is a case where the window is active on one screen already,

    Cleanup linkage handling and use rpath for plugins.
    
    rpath is generally bad because it results in stupid linkage which can
    break with distribution upgrades (which is the reason for previous
    commits which use ldconfig LIBDIR). However, it doesn't appear to be
    against any distribution's policy to use rpath for "internal" libraries
    such as plugins linking against each other - so instead of adding those
    rather generic names to the ld.so cache, just specify an rpath, since there
    is no way there would be multiple versions of a plugin at once (and even then
    plugins would have to manually link).
    
    This *does* stretch the boundaries allowed by distributions slightly however,
    since other plugins usually have to link with libcomposite and libopengl
    in order to load them, however we have our own system of safeguard checks
    to ensure that the right plugins are loaded in any case (since the linkage
    will change dynamically on dlopen () - the initial linkage is only there
    so that dlopen () will not complain when it can't find the composite and
    opengl libraries, but in that case, it wouldn't even matter anyways since
    those plugins have to be loaded in order to be useful)
    
    For distribution policy, see:

    Keep pixmaps of unmapped windows around if they are used for animations.
    
    Previously, they were discarded if the window was resized right after being unmapped. As that might end close animations too early, keep the pixmap around until setting the internal state to 'unmapped'. For those cases, the pixmap size (width/height) will differ from the window geometry (attrib.width/attrib.height), though, so plugins should use the former values for animation purposes.

    Fix window position validation for windows changing size but not position
    
    Previously, we left the position of windows that have USPosition set untouched, even if they didn't try to change position at all, but only changed size. This caused such windows to become partially offscreen e.g. if they were positioned at the lower edge of the work area before the size change and increased height afterwards.

    has constant complexity, as it keeps a counter.

    This didn't work as expected, as windows' input was still above panels
    even though windows looked like they were behind panels, whenever the
    problem happened. When fullscreen mode is initiated in evince, this
    commit also caused windows to have their input in front
    of evince's fullscreen window even though the fullscreen window appears
    to be in front of them. This in turn triggered a freeze when the user
    clicks on the screen in evince while in fullscreen mode.

    Previously this worked due to the order that the events arived in, however, now we want it to be stacked above correct window straight away so that we do not restack it again when configureNotify event comes through

Joel Bosveld <Joel.Bosveld@gmail.com>	2009-04-07

    Restack window list immediately when calling reconfigureXWindow
    
    Previously, trying to restack multiple windows wouldn't work as expected, as the window list wasn't restacked until the configureNotify was recieved, which lead to it stacking the window above the wrong window

    Ensure windows fit in the work area when placing them by calling the window sizing validation function.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

    Make viewportForGeometry not take the current viewport into account.
    As the geometry passed to viewportForGeometry is not necessarily a window, it doesn't make much sense to assume so.
    Instead, move the return-current-viewport-if-window-is-on-it logic to the defaultViewportForWindow function.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

    Make sure geometry rectangle is kept inside the screen area.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

    If a property with 0 items was set, the return value was leaked.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

    Use timer to start decorator.
    When starting the decorator from initScreen, user changes to a default decorator command are not reflected correctly. When starting it _only_ from the option change notification, no decorator is started if the default is non-empty and the user never changed it.
    Compromise is using a timer and hoping that the configuration plugin has initialized all options at next mainloop iteration time (which is the case for all known configuration plugins).

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

    Build fix.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

    Use pendingMaps variable to set w->managed on MapNotify.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-04

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Make sure  RGBA matching is always present for shadows.
    If the user added RGBA expressions to the match, use those.
    If the user did not add any RGBA expressions, turn off shadows for RGBA windows.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Add support for matching a window's alpha channel availability.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Improve focus stealing prevention.
    - Allow window focus if currently no window or only the desktop window is focussed.

    - Allow focus attempts of windows of the same application in Low, Normal, High modes.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Allow mouse initiated resize not only in the 4 corners, but in all directions.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Limit number of damage rects in one screen repaint.
    If the number of rects grows too much, we're using more resources managing the damage than doing the actual drawing.

    Added support for _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE_CANCEL.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Try to find the window under the pointer through the server if d->below is not valid.
    This may happen e.g. if focusDefaultWindow() is called right after moveScreenViewport(), as the EnterNotify event hasn't arrived at that time yet.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-10-03

    Also update d->below variable when we have a grab, so that it has the correct value after grab end.
    Needed e.g. for focussing the correct default window after viewport changes with click_to_focus disabled.

Dennis Kasprzyk <onestone@compiz-fusion.org>	2008-10-02

    Add another overlapping output handling mode "Smart". "Smart" basically is the old "Prefer larger" mode, selecting the output most part of the rectangle is on. "Prefer larger" and "Prefer smaller" only look for the rectangle center to determine the output.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-03-10

    Reduce duplicated code by reusing the outputDeviceForGeometry function to implement outputDeviceForPoint. For this, treat a point x,y just as a 1x1 sized rectangle which has its upper left corner at x,y.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-03-10

    Clamp point/geometry to compare to visible screen area.
     When not doing that, always the current output is returned for windows that aren't visible, which is not desired.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-03-10

    Make outputDeviceForGeometry behave smarter when dealing with overlapping outputs.
    Currently, the current output is returned if some part of the rectangle is on it; otherwise the output device the rectangle center is on is returned. This works fine for non-overlapping outputs, but with overlapping outputs, the window center may be on multiple outputs, making the determination ambiguous.
    This patch applies the following strategy instead:
    - Determine the output the largest part of the rectangle area is on.
    - If there are multiple outputs with equally large parts, return the best output based on a user-selectable strategy.
    - Otherwise, return the output that contains the largest part.
    
    This commit also reverts large parts of commit 1a233a20d1de2b504b707fe79ad36268e683eb5d.

    Allow minimizing non-transient dialog windows.
    Transient child dialog can be minimized by minimizing their parent, but non-transients can not; which is why we should allow them to be minimized.
    This change also allows that every window which has the minimize action allowed to be minimized by external applications (such as the decorator), which should be desired behaviour anyway.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2008-01-20

    Allow maximizing dialog windows.
    If the app doesn't intend to prevent size changes for the dialog (by setting minimum/maximum size constraints), there's no reason why we should prevent dialog maximization.

    Make sure the position is randomized only for windows that are smaller than the workarea.
    Otherwise, the mod operator may be called for numbers smaller or equal than 0, leading to a crash.

    This reverts commit 8af9c24dee10bf827f1784db1590d0d9bcae9a93.
    
    The decoration must be added before core handles the map request so that it can be taken into consideration properly for the initial window placement.

    Handle MapRequest event after core so that decorWindowUpdate sees window type and override_redirect state changes that might have happened during event processing.

    Recalculate window type and window actions if override_redirect state changed.

Danny Baumann <dannybaumann@web.de>	2007-09-11

    Check for changes to the override_redirect flag on window map.
    Rationale: Another client (such as Wine) might have changed it while the window was unmapped, and we are not guaranteed to get a configure notify event after map so it might happen that we don't treat the window correctly.

    This reverts commit d7a6af1c6b86bb10eb672901fcddcb0e2d05f579.
    
    Using a timeout is not the proper solution but revert to
    this as a ExpHandlerChanged call before regex plugin has
    initialized all objects will definitely not work. A proper
    solution will be added once the new object system is fully
    in place.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-09-05

    Add objectAdd and objectRemove hooks to core. These are similar to
    windowAddNotify and windowRemoveNotify but provide the same
    functionality for all object types. The parent field in object
    struct is set by the core implementation of this function, which
    means that the parent field can be used to check if object is
    properly initialized or not. Objects with parent field not yet
    set must never be passed to a wrap-able function. Plugins should
    simple not call any core functions from the initObject function
    unless parent field has been set.

Dennis Kasprzyk <onestone@beryl-project.org>	2007-03-12

    Added blur occlusion detection. This will disable multiple levels of blur on overlapping blur regions.

Dennis Kasprzyk <onestone@beryl-project.org>	2007-03-12

    Save lastPaint and lastMask during occlusion detection.

Dennis Kasprzyk <onestone@beryl-project.org>	2007-03-12

    Don't blur opaque windows if decorations are also blured.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-12

    Track changes to decoration plugin. Switcher window is a decorated window
    so motif hints that tell the WM not to decorate it shouldn't be set. The
    only problem with this is that the switcher window might appear with
    default decorations for short period before the decorator is able to
    update it with correct decorations. This is still much more correct than
    before and if the default decorations turns out to be a problem we'll
    come up with more correct solution for that.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-12

    Update decoration selection so it makes a bit more sense. The decorator
    shouldn't be able to override hints.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-12

    Add decoration match option.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-12

    Call repaint to make sure decorations are updated properly when
    they are resized.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-09

    Some themes update the layout when the borders function is called
    so we should call it with the correct window state after we've
    used it for getting maximized border size.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-09

    Add fuse plugin. It provides a user space file-system with compiz
    information. E.g. all options are represented as directories and
    and current values can be retrieved by reading files in these
    directories.
    
    It's read-only right now but write support will be added soon and
    it will allow you to manipulate options by writing to files.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-08

    Rewrite restackWindowBelow. The old implementation was broken as
    it allowed stacking to positions where windows are not allowed to
    be. New implementation makes sure windows are always stacked at
    allowed positions.
    
    This issue caused windows being prevented from focus to sometimes
    be placed behind one of it's ancestors.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-07

    The active viewport coordinate solution is not good enough in a lot of
    cases where windows span more than one viewport. Replace most of it
    with a general active window history stored in the screen structure.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-03-07

    Add activeViewportX and activeViewportX members to the
    CompWindow struct to keep track of the viewport the window

    to which window the input focus should be moved to and the
    compareWindowActiveness function has been added to make this more
    convenient.

    Add plugin that provides regular expression matching for window
    title, class and name. It can very easily be extended to provide
    matching of other window related strings.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-02-23

    Update to use match object for window matching.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-02-23

    Add extensible match interface. Match objects can be used for
    window matching but other objects than windows will likely be
    supported sometime soon. A match object contains a boolean tree
    of expressions and each expression can be implemented by a
    different plugin. The core interface only provides window type
    matching.
    
    Plugins can provide any kind of matching by wrapping
    the matchInitExp display function. When doing so they
    are responsible for calling the matchExpHandlerChange
    function when their ability to evaluate expressions
    changed (e.g. when being activated or deactivated).
    They should also call the matchPropertyChanged function
    when a window property that might affect evaluation of
    an expression changed.

    some fragment function data is performing a blend operation.
    
    Functions for allocating fragment parameters and fragment texture units
    now take a integer parameter that specifies the number of units or
    parameters that should be allocated.
    
    Add initial destination blur support to blur plugin. The current state
    of destination blur is generally not considered usable. There's a few

    Add blur plugin. This plugin is currently only doing source blurring and
    the functionality is pretty limited but destination blurring and more
    functionality will be added be added shortly. However, even in it's

    Fix a few initiate functions that should steal events.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-01-10

    Add Fragment Attribute Interface.
    
    This interface (FAI) makes it possible for plugins to provide
    programmable per-fragment operations. Each plugin can add a set of
    fragment functions to the fragment attributes that are used for
    a drawing operation. A fragment function contains a set of data
    defined by some existing extension to OpenGL that provide
    programmable per-fragment operations. Current version of this
    interface only support GL_ARB_fragment_program but it is designed
    in such a way that it can very easily be extended to support other
    OpenGL extensions.
    
    The FAI also provide mechanisms which allow plugins to allocated
    texture units and parameters for private use.
    
    The fragment attribute implementation contains methods for
    combining a set fragment functions into a fragment program
    that can be used by OpenGL for per-fragment operations.
    
    The major benefit of the FAI is that it provides a pluggable
    way to use programmable per-fragment operations and will allow
    us to take advantage of the latest OpenGL extensions and
    create some really amazing effects while still making sure
    that everything integrate perfectly.

    Only update window position when no pending position changes exists.

David Reveman <davidr@novell.com>	2007-01-02

    Move away from having client side positioning of windows. Window
    size must be server side so to be able to do atomic move-resize
    operations position must also be server-side. This means that
    serverX and serverY fields in CompWindow struct has higher priority
    than attrib.x and attrib.y. attrib.x and attrib.y is still the client
    side position and any code dealing with the visible position of a
    window should use these. Code that needs to be aware of any pending
    position changes should look at serverX and serverY.

    Fix corner cases with big titlebar fonts.

    the upper or lower part of the titlebar does not receive input events.

Kristian Høgsberg <krh@redhat.com>	2006-09-20

    Tighten the double click criteria.
    
    If the distance between the two clicks are greater than 8
    pixels it is not regarded as a double click.  This is in line with how
    GTK+ detects double clicks.  There's an X root window property or
    similar that defines the distance and ideally we should read that out,
    but for now the patch brings the behavior a little closer to
    what it should be.

Kristian Høgsberg <krh@redhat.com>	2006-09-20

    Only activate button actions on left click.
    
    Right now all mouse buttons activate the titlebar button action
    (minimize, maximize, close), which is a bit unusual.
    Metacity only activates the action on left click and opens the window
    menu for right clicks.  This patch just disables the button actions
    for anything else but left clicks.

Kristian Høgsberg <krh@redhat.com>	2006-09-20

    Add support for the composite overlay window.
    
    Add support for using the composite overlay window for
    GL output instead of rendering to the root window.  This is lets
    compiz run on AIGLX without the _COMPIZ_GL_INCLUDE_INFERIORS hack that
    we used to have.  The patch defaults to using the root window but adds
    a '--use-cow' command line option to make compiz use the overlay
    window.

    tweak eventMatches slightly to allow extra modifiers to be down when
        recognizing a modifier keypress. (Eg, don't require the user to release
        Alt before pressing Control to get window snapping.)

Dan Winship <danw@novell.com>	2006-04-28

    new method that replaces EV_KEY and EV_BUTTON. Tests if an event matches a
        binding, being more precise about modifier state than EV_KEY and
        EV_BUTTON were. (eventTerminates): Tests if an event is "the opposite"
        of a binding. (Eg, button or modifier key release.) Replaces
        CompReleaseMask and "terminate" bindings. (handleEvent): Use
        eventMatches
    When passed a keybinding containing just modifiers, grab/ungrab every
        keypress event that would result in that modifier state (eg, both left
        and right modifier keys, and allow them to be pressed in any order).
    Remove CompPressMask from default bindings. (eventLoop): don't add virtual
        modifiers to event state. (updateModifierMappings): store the
        XModifierKeymap for later use.
    Use eventMatches and eventTerminates. Remove CompPressMask and "terminate"
        bindings (except from scale, which is different from the others).
    Make initiate_all be just the modifier key used in addition to the initiate
        binding ("<Control>"). Remove next_window since it doesn't make a lot
        of sense to have it be different from initiate_all, and make
        prev_window be just a modifier key as well. ("<Shift>").
        (SwitchScreen): add extra options to store the fully-composed
        initiate_all, prev, and prev_all bindings. (switchScreenInitOptions,
        switchSetScreenOption): Generate and regenerate initiate_all, prev, and
        prev_all bindings as needed. (switchHandleEvent): update
    Remove "<Release>" handling.
    regen, dropping the terminate bindings and updating a few others.

    Request the default value of the key from gconf, rather than initializing
        the key to the internal default value if it hasn't yet been set by the
        user. Notably, this makes it so that "compiz gconf" on a new account
        will use the default value of active_plugins rather than the
        (effectively empty) list of plugins on the command line. (It also makes
        it so that the sysadmin can override defaults via sabayon or whatever.)
