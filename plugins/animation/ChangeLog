    There is probably a better way to do this, but it needs to be looked into

    Add MultiAnim class, this class allows animations to draw multiple
    copies of a window
    
    The class is a template class, so to use it you'll need to create
    a class which represents a single copy of your window which you
    want to animate, and then create a new animation class which inherits:
    
        public MultiAnim <YourAnim, numberOfCopies>
    
    The class automatically hands off virtual function calls to your
    animation's class. In order to determine which copy of the window
    you are animating, you can call:
    
        MultiAnim <YourAnim, numberOfCopies>::getCurrAnimationNumber (AnimWindow *);

    normals. Also we now allow polygon objects with 0 thickness. Airplane normals
    are removed as side face normals are not necessary for 0-thickness objects.

    Fix finite freeze w/ superkaramba after monitor standby.
    
    Some system monitor applications like superkaramba widgets
    (create and) destroy an (invisible) window every second, which
    was triggering an unnecessary addWindowDamage in Animation
    plugin for those windows. When the monitor is in stand-by mode,
    compiz doesn't redraw the screen, causing these (potential)
    closing animations to be delayed until the user returns
    leading to high cpu usage or a (finite) freeze at that time.
    This fix prevents the problem by not calling addWindowDamage
    for such windows.

    will be (especially tooltip and menu animations will benefit significantly).
